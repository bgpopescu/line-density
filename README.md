# How to calculate line density within a polygon

This is Jupyter notebook that shows step-by-step what the procedures are to calculate road density per district using Python and ArcGIS functions. The tutorial provides not only the code in order to run specific functions in ArcGIS but it also highlights conceptually what the required steps are in order to obtain a choropleth map showing density of roads within a district.
